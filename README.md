# Speech-Speech-Translation

To implement Speech to Speech Translation without any text intermediate, we have used the model `SeamlessM4T` develop by `Meta AI`. It is a pre-trained model, which has been already trained on wide variety of datasets.

### Running the code
- Clone the github repository to set up the model.
- Install the necessary libraries like FairSeq2 and Pydub.
- Run the cells of the Jupyter notebook.
- Refer to the documentation to identify the code for the target language and change the variable accordingly.
- Use the `predict` function to translate the audio snippet and the result is displayed.
